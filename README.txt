Foodture


<Description>
Our project focuses on the United Nations sustainability goal 2, which is “Zero Hunger”. 
Through our research, we found out that 1 in 10 Singaporeans struggled to get sufficient, safe and nutritious food at least once in the last 12 months. 
Hence we have come up with a application which helps people find affordable yet nutritious food around them. 


<Features>
1. Map: 
Through this feature, users can easily find supermarkets or stores around them who are giving away food at cheaper rates through markers.

2. Store Product Listing: 
Upon clicking on the markers on the map, users will be able to see a full list view of products available. They are also able to search for items they are looking for.

3. Product Detail Page:
After selecting the product from the list, users can find out more information about the product like the source and add it to the shopping list.

4. Shopping List: 
Through this feature, users can view the list of products available near them and that is added to a list. We chose not to include a shopping cart and Buy Now feature because we realised that the delivery fee may not be affordable to some.
