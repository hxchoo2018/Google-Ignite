# flutter_plugin_demo

Demo of Flutter Plugins, built on top of default Flutter starter app.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

### Instructions

1. Clone main branch of this repo, we will start from this skeleton app which already contains a few examples you may find useful for your projects:
    - Recap from First Flutter App pt.2 (ListView.builder on a list).
    - Different flavors of arguments in Dart (positional, named, required).
    - Multi-page setup with navigation routes.
    - Handling async events and using FutureBuilder.
2. In Part 1 of the tutorial, we will explore using an existing Flutter Plugin (camera) to arrive at the completed demo (reference code in [completed](https://github.com/devYaoYH/Flutter-Plugin-Demo/tree/completed) branch).
3. In Part 2 of the tutorial (Bonus), we will explore authoring our own Flutter Plugin using the Pigeon tool (reference code in [custom_plugin](https://github.com/devYaoYH/Flutter-Plugin-Demo/tree/custom_plugin) branch).
